      <p>Here are some interesting facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm currently a pharmacy technician who is in the process of switching career paths to Software Development.</li>
        <li>I currently reside in Los Angeles county.</li>
        <li>I am a Web Developer and a Software Engineer.</li>
        <li>I like to believe what sets me apart from others is that I'm a very creative person and adapt to new environments pretty quickly. I also love new creative ideas from others.</li>

      <h2>Connecting with Me</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Ever since I decided to consider Software Engineering, I honestly fell in love with it. The fact that the creative opportunities are endless is the most exciting thing to me about Software. What's even more exciting is the fact that I have an opportunity to be apart of a Software team and work with like-minded individuals.</p>
      <p>Now, as exciting and fun as coding is, there are still moments when I get stuck and frustrated. So to help myself reboot and re-think with a fresh mind, I love to solve a Rubik's cube or go for a hike or even rock climb. But my new found passion is rollerskating. It's just something about rollerskating that's so soothing and makes me feel as though I'm levitating and when I'm able to accomplish a new trick that I've been working on, it's just so rewarding.</p>

      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>As someone who is currently learning HTML, CSS & Javascript I feel as though I can definitely provide Web Development. I can create websites for your company, business or whatever is necessary.</p>
      <p>Although I have a pharmacy background I believe that the knowledge I have obtained for detail and precision helps me a lot with Software Development.</p>
